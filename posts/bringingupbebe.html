	<h1>Hack the Parent: Notes and highlights from Bringing up Bebe</h1>
		<p>Bringing up Bebe was the first book I picked up on parenting, and I read it a full decade before I would have a kid.</p>
  <p>I always tell friends to start with this book. It's not preachy or prescriptive, rather it's highly entertaining –– American woman marries Englishman, moves to France for reasons, slowly realizes she's raising French children.</p>
  <p>The book made me realize that it's worth learning parenting long before you have a kid, because once you have a kid, you're inevitably operating on limited sleep and other suboptimal conditions. Your job as a new parent is keep child alive. If you wish to pick a parenting philosophy or possibly blend your own, the ideal starting line not the starting line –– it's before hello world. </p>
<p>We took blueprints from this book, namely concrete approaches to sleeping and eating, but also meta approaches to learning to wait and play.</p>
<p>Let's kick off with this: <i>“There are dozens of books offering Americans helpful theories on how to parent differently.
			I haven’t got a theory. What I do have, spread out in front of me, is a fully functioning society of good little sleepers, gourmet eaters, and reasonably relaxed parents. I’m starting with that outcome and working backward to figure out how the French got there. It turns out that to be a different kind of parent, you don’t just need a different parenting philosophy. You need a very different view of what a child actually is.”</i></p>
<h2>Sleeping</h2>
<p>–– "“Why is it that so many of the American kids I meet are on mono-diets of pasta or white rice, or eat only a narrow menu of “kids” foods, whereas most of my daughter’s French friends eat fish, vegetables, and practically everything else? And how is it that, except for a specific time in the afternoon, French kids don’t snack?”</p>
