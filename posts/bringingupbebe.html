	<h1>Hack the Parent/h1>
		<h2>Notes and highlights from Bringing up Bebe<</h2>
		<p>Bringing up Bebe was the first book I picked up on parenting. I read it in 2012, a full decade before I would have a kid.</p>
  <p>I tell friends to start with this book. It's not preachy or prescriptive, and it's highly entertaining –– American woman marries Englishman, moves to France for reasons, slowly realizes she's raising French children.</p>
  <p>The book made me realize that it's worth learning parenting long before you have a kid. Once you have a kid, you're operating on limited sleep and other suboptimal conditions. Your job as a new parent is keep child alive. If you wish to pick a parenting philosophy or possibly blend your own, the ideal starting line is *not* the starting line –– it's before hello world. </p>
<p>We took blueprints from this book re: sleeping and eating. We codified our family hierarchy priorities (marraige above all else) and we started to form some other pillars around self-reliance and other personality traits we value.</p>
<p>Let's kick off with this: 
	<blockquote><i>“There are dozens of books offering Americans helpful theories on how to parent differently.
			I haven’t got a theory. What I do have, spread out in front of me, is a fully functioning society of good little sleepers, gourmet eaters, and reasonably relaxed parents. I’m starting with that outcome and working backward to figure out how the French got there. It turns out that to be a different kind of parent, you don’t just need a different parenting philosophy. You need a very different view of what a child actually is.”</i></blockquote>

<h3>Highlights on being American</h3>

		<blockquote>“The Americans I know also believe that [parenthood] comes with homework. The first assignment is choosing from among myriad parenting styles. Everyone I speak to swears by different books. I buy many of them.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“[Frenchwomen] don’t treat [parenting] like an independent research project. There are plenty of French parenting books, magazines, and Web sites. But these aren’t required reading, and nobody seems to consume them in bulk. Certainly no one I meet is comparison shopping for a parenting philosophy or can refer to different techniques by name.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“I’ve come to the United States to visit family and friends, and also to get a hands-on feel for one corner of American parenting. ... I thought I knew my parenting literature. But these women make it clear that I’m just a dilettante. Not only have they read everything, they’ve also assembled their own parenting styles like eclectic designer outfits, following separate gurus for sleep, discipline, and food.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote></blockquote>
		
<h3>Highlights on sleeping</h3>

		<blockquote>“Of course she’s not “doing her nights.” She’s two months old (and then three months, and then four). Everyone knows that tiny babies sleep badly.</blockquote>
		
		<blockquote>My Anglophone friends and family ... tend to ask the more open-ended question, “How is she sleeping?” And even that isn’t really a request for information; it’s a chance for the exhausted parents to vent.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“But soon the evidence becomes overwhelming: having a baby who sleeps through the night early on seems to be the norm in France. Just as stories of terrible sleepers are easy to find among Americans, stories of spectacular sleepers are easy to find among the French.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“... when your baby is born, just don’t jump on your kid at night,” Cohen says. “Give your baby a chance to self-soothe, don’t automatically respond, even from birth.” ... “For Cohen, this pause—I’m tempted to call it La Pause—is crucial. He says that using it very early on makes a big difference in how babies sleep. “The parents who were a little less responsive to late-night fussing always had kids who were good sleepers, while the jumpy folks had kids who would wake up repeatedly at night until it became unbearable,” he writes....  “One reason for pausing is that young babies make a lot of movements and noise while they’re sleeping. This is normal and fine. If parents rush in and pick the baby up every time he makes a peep, they’ll sometimes wake him up.” ... “I’m not saying let your baby wail.” What he’s saying is, just give your baby a chance to learn.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“ If parents do “The Pause” in a baby’s first two months, the baby can learn to fall back to sleep on his own. So his parents won’t need to resort to “crying it out” later on. The Pause doesn’t have the brutal feeling of sleep training. It’s more like sleep teaching. But the window for it is pretty small. According to Cohen, it’s only until the baby is four months old. After that, bad sleep habits are formed.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“French parents believe it’s their job to gently teach babies how to sleep well, the same way they’ll later teach them to have good hygiene, eat balanced meals, and ride a bike. They don’t view being up half the night with an eight-month-old as a sign of parental commitment. They view it as a sign that the child has a sleep problem and that his family is wildly out of balance.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“For the French, teaching a small baby to sleep isn’t a self-serving strategy for lazy parents. It’s a crucial first lesson for children in self-reliance and enjoying one’s own company.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“Simon and I just assumed that, for quite a while, we’d rearrange our lives around [our child's] whims. The French don’t think that’s good for anyone. They view learning to sleep as part of learning to be part of the family, and adapting to what other members of the family need, too. ”</blockquote>
	
<h3>Highlights on eating</h3>
<blockquote>"Why is it that so many of the American kids I meet are on mono-diets of pasta or white rice, or eat only a narrow menu of “kids” foods, whereas most of my daughter’s French friends eat fish, vegetables, and practically everything else? And how is it that, except for a specific time in the afternoon, French kids don’t snack?”</blockquote>
		
<h3>Highlights on 'interestingness'</h3>
		<p>About her husband:</p>
		<blockquotea>“Also to Simon’s credit, nothing about France ever bothers him. He’s in his element being a foreigner. His parents are anthropologists who raised him all over the world and trained him from birth to delight in local customs. He’d lived in six countries (including a year in the United States) by the time he was ten. He acquires languages the way I acquire shoes.”</blockquotea>
<blockquote>“And I like the idea of having them in Paris, where they’ll be effortlessly bilingual and authentically international. ... they can mention “growing up in Paris” and be instantly cool.”</blockquote>
