	<h1>Hack the Parent</h1>
		<h2>Book: Bringing Up Bebe by Pamela Druckerman (2012)</h2>

		<p>Bringing Up Bebe was the first book I read on parenting. I read it in 2012, a decade before I would have a kid.</p>

  		<p>This is the book I tell friends to start with. It's not preachy or prescriptive, it's actually highly entertaining –– American woman marries Englishman, moves to France for reasons, slowly realizes she's raising French children, while she, for better or for worse, remains very American.</p>

		<p>We learned so much about what we wanted to do from this book. Listed out it all sounds so trite: we wanted a good sleeper. We wanted a good eater. We wanted a kid who enjoyed his own company.</p>

		<p>A more honest list would be the extent of what we were willing to do to maximize the odds of achieving those things. Like prioritizing sleep habits from literally day 1, because bad sleep habits are formed as early as four months old. Like being totally immovable about bedtime and never dropping the second nap, because kids need 14-16 hours of sleep until three years old and then 10-14 hours of sleep until 12 years old.</p>

		<p>Everyone wants the best for their children. And at least from my perspective, pretty much everyone tries their best for their children.</p>

		<p>I think we have a high risk tolerance for being unpopular.</p>

		<p><b>TLDR</b></p>

		<p> –– American parenting preparation is researching and worrying, French parenting preparation is mostly tuning into intutition</p>

		<p>–– Americans operate under the assumption that "tiny babies sleep badly", whereas in France it's normal for babies to start sleeping through the night by two months old</p>

		<p>–– The French do NOT view sleepless nights as parental selflessness or duty –– they view it as the "family is wildly out of balance"</p>

		<p>–– The French don't suffer kids food ("mono-diets of pasta and white rice"), they make it a big priority for children to eat well and widely</p>

		<p>–– If this book resonates with you, Montessori parenting and RIE parenting may also resonate</p>

		<p> –– If you want to read this book without her life story, try her other book, Bebe Day by Day, which distills everything more or less into 100 sound bites</p>

	
<p><b>Selected excerpts from Bringing Up Bebe ––</b></p>
	
		<blockquote>“There are dozens of books offering Americans helpful theories on how to parent differently. I haven’t got a theory. What I do have, spread out in front of me, is a fully functioning society of good little sleepers, gourmet eaters, and reasonably relaxed parents. I’m starting with that outcome and working backward to figure out how the French got there. It turns out that to be a different kind of parent, you don’t just need a different parenting philosophy. You need a very different view of what a child actually is.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“The Americans I know also believe that [parenthood] comes with homework. The first assignment is choosing from among myriad parenting styles. Everyone I speak to swears by different books. I buy many of them.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“[The French] don’t treat [parenting] like an independent research project. There are plenty of French parenting books, magazines, and Web sites. But these aren’t required reading, and nobody seems to consume them in bulk. Certainly no one I meet [in France] is comparison shopping for a parenting philosophy or can refer to different techniques by name.”</blockquote>
		
		<blockquote>"[When American] friends and family ... ask the more open-ended question, “How is she sleeping?” ... that isn’t really a request for information; it’s a chance for the exhausted parents to vent.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“Just as stories of terrible sleepers are easy to find among Americans, stories of spectacular sleepers are easy to find among the French.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“... just don’t jump on your kid at night,” Cohen says. “Give your baby a chance to self-soothe, don’t automatically respond, even from birth.” ... He says that using it very early on makes a big difference in how babies sleep. “The parents who were a little less responsive to late-night fussing always had kids who were good sleepers, while the jumpy folks had kids who would wake up repeatedly at night until it became unbearable,” he writes."</blockquote>
	
		<blockquote>“One reason for pausing is that young babies make a lot of movements and noise while they’re sleeping. This is normal and fine. If parents rush in and pick the baby up every time he makes a peep, they’ll sometimes wake him up.” ... “I’m not saying let your baby wail.” What he’s saying is, just give your baby a chance to learn.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“If parents do “The Pause” in a baby’s first two months, the baby can learn to fall back to sleep on his own. So his parents won’t need to resort to “crying it out” later on. The Pause doesn’t have the brutal feeling of sleep training. It’s more like sleep teaching. But the window for it is pretty small. According to Cohen, it’s only until the baby is four months old. After that, bad sleep habits are formed.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“For the French, teaching a small baby to sleep isn’t a self-serving strategy for lazy parents. It’s a crucial first lesson for children in self-reliance and enjoying one’s own company.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“Simon and I just assumed that, for quite a while, we’d rearrange our lives around [our child's] whims. The French don’t think that’s good for anyone. They view learning to sleep as part of learning to be part of the family, and adapting to what other members of the family need, too. ”</blockquote>
	
		<blockquote>"... most of my daughter’s French friends eat fish, vegetables, and practically everything else? And how is it that, except for a specific time in the afternoon, French kids don’t snack?”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"It strikes me that Martine doesn’t expect her daughter to be perfectly patient. She assumes that Paulette will sometimes grab stuff and make mistakes. But Martine doesn’t overreact to these mistakes, the way that I tend to. She understands that all this baking and waiting is practice in building a skill. In other words, Martine is even patient about teaching patience. When Paulette tries to interrupt our conversation, Martine says, “Just wait two minutes, my little one. I’m in the middle of talking.” It’s both very polite and very firm. I’m struck both by how sweetly Martine says it and by how certain she seems that Paulette will obey her."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"[She warns that parents shouldn’t mistake angering a child for bad parenting. To the contrary, “If the parent can’t stand the fact of being hated, then he won’t frustrate the child, and then the child will be in a situation where he will be the object of his own tyranny, where basically he has to deal with his own greed and his own need for things. If the parent isn’t there to stop him, then he’s the one who’s going to have to stop himself or not stop himself, and that’s much more anxiety-provoking."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"We Americans assign ourselves the job of pushing, stimulating, and carrying our kids from one developmental stage to the next. The better we are at parenting, we think, the faster our kids will develop. ...	French parents just don’t seem so anxious for their kids to get head starts. They don’t push them to read, swim, or do math ahead of schedule. They aren’t trying to prod them into becoming prodigies."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"Rousseau says the biggest parenting trap is to think that because a child can argue well, his argument deserves the same weight as your own. “The worst education is to leave him floating between his will and yours and to dispute endlessly between you and him as to which of the two will be the master.” For Rousseau, the only possible master is the parent. He often seems to be describing the cadre—or frame—that is the model for today’s French parents. The ideal of the cadre is that parents are very strict about certain things but very relaxed about most everything else.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"When I bring Bean to get her first inoculations, I cradle her in my arms and apologize to her for the pain she’s about to experience. The French pediatrician scolds me. “You don’t say ‘I’m sorry,’” he says. “Getting shots is part of life. There’s no reason to apologize for that.” He seems to be channeling Rousseau, who said, “If by too much care you spare them every kind of discomfort, you are preparing great miseries for them."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>““Dolto’s core message isn’t a “parenting philosophy.” But if you accept that children are rational as a first principle—as French society does—then many things begin to shift. If babies understand what you’re saying to them, then you can teach them quite a lot, even while they’re very young."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"Dolto famously insisted that older children “pay” her at the end of each session, with an object, like a stone, to emphasize their independence and accountability. This respect for children resonated strongly with Dolto’s students. “She changed everything, and we, the students, wanted things to change,” the psychoanalyst Myriam Szejer recalls."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"This incident revealed the enormous cultural gap between Lara and me, as parents. I had assumed that Bean was a very cute, very wild creature with a lot of potential but almost no self-control. If she occasionally behaved well, it was because of a kind of animalistic training, or just luck."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“Bean spends a lot of the day [at the crèche] just ambling around the room, playing with whatever she wants. I’m concerned about this. Where are the music circles and organized activities?” ... “It’s the French cadre model yet again: kids get firm boundaries, but lots of freedom within those boundaries. And they’re supposed to learn to cope with boredom and to play by themselves. “When the child plays, he constructs himself,” Sylvie, another of Bean’s caregivers, tells me.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"I also like the neutral, pragmatic French formulation “paying attention” over the value-laden American one, “being good” (and its guilt-ridden, demoralizing opposites: “cheating” and “being bad”)."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"American-style parenting and its accoutrements—the baby flash cards and competitive preschools—are by now clichés. There’s been both a backlash and a backlash to the backlash. So I’m stunned by what I see at a playground in New York City."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"On Bastille Day, I take Bean to the grassy field in our neighborhood park. ... along with a giant sack of books and toys for her. I spend a lot of the day helping her play with the toys and reading to her. On the next blanket over is a French mother. She’s a thin, auburn-haired woman who’s chatting with a girlfriend while her year-old daughter plays with, well, not much of anything. The mother seems to have brought just one ball to amuse her daughter for the entire afternoon. They have lunch, and then the little girl plays with the grass, rolls around a bit, and checks out the scene. Meanwhile, her mother has a full adult conversation with her friend. It’s the same sun and the same grass. But I’m having an American picnic and—voilà—she’s having a French one."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"Making kids say bonjour isn’t just for the benefit of grown-ups. It’s also to help kids learn that they’re not the only ones with feelings and needs. ... “Kids who ignore people, and don’t say bonjour or au revoir, they just stay in their bubble. Since parents are dedicated to them already, when will they get the sense that they are there to give, not just to receive?""</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"The reigning view in America seems to be that kids have finicky, limited palates, and that adults who venture beyond grilled cheese do so at their peril. This belief is, of course, self-fulfilling. Many of the American kids I meet do have finicky and limited palates. Frequently they spend a few years on a kind of mono-diet. A friend in Atlanta has one son who eats only white foods like rice and pasta. Her other son eats only meat. Another friend’s baby nephew in Boston was supposed to start eating solid foods around Christmas. When the boy refused to eat anything but foil-wrapped chocolate Santas, his parents hoarded bags of them, afraid they’d be out of stock after the holidays."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"One of the most impressive parts of French parenting—and perhaps the toughest one to master—is authority. Many French parents I meet have an easy, calm authority with their children that I can only envy. Often, their kids actually listen to them. French children aren’t constantly dashing off, talking back, or engaging in prolonged negotiations. But how exactly do French parents pull this off? And how can I acquire this magical authority, too?"</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"“France feels like a different planet. Even the most bohemian parents boast about how strict they are and seem unequivocal about being at the top of the family hierarchy. ... "It’s parents, then children,” she says of the family pecking order. In France, she explains, “sharing power with a child doesn’t exist.""</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“Marc adds, “We have a saying in French: it’s easier to loosen the screw than to tighten the screw, meaning that you have to be very tough. If you’re too tough, you loosen. But if you are too lenient, afterward to tighten, forget about it.” Marc is describing the cadre that French parents spend the early years of a child’s life constructing. ...	American parents like me just assume that we’ll have to chase our kids around the park all afternoon or spend half a dinner party putting them to bed. It’s irritating, but it’s come to seem normal. For French parents, living with a child-king seems wildly out of balance and bad for the whole family. ... They know that building this cadre requires enormous effort, but they believe that the alternative is unacceptable.”</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"It takes me a while to realize that French and American parents also use the word “strict” quite differently. I don’t know many American parents who use this word to describe themselves. But almost all the French parents I know do."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"Building a cadre for your kids is a lot of work. In the early years, it requires much repetition and attention. ... The French way also requires a paradigm shift. I’m so used to believing that everything revolves around the kids."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"French parents will often let small kids race ahead of them on the sidewalk. They trust that the kids will stop at the corner and wait for them. Watching this is particularly terrifying when the kids are on scooters. I live in a world of worst-case scenarios."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"Americans don’t like tattletales, either. However, in France, even among kids, having the inner resolve to suffer some scrapes and keep your lips sealed is considered a life skill. Even within families, people are entitled to their secrets."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"Not only don’t teachers and authority figures in France routinely praise children to their faces but, to my great disappointment, they also don’t routinely praise children to their parents."</blockquote>
