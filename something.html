	<h1>Hack the Parent</h1>
	<p>Parenting is a war of attrition. Your spouse is your comrade, in the trenches with you.</p>
	<p>However, the enemy is not the child –– the enemy is you.</p>
	<p>Well, sometimes it's the child. Sometimes it's the school or the grandparents or the various sytems you live in.</p>
	<p>You can't control those things –– you have the most control over you.</p>
	<p>Here is where I'll be compiling highlights and notes from books I'm reading.</p>
