	<h1>Hack the Parent</h1>
	<p>Parenting is a war of attrition –– your spouse is your comrade, in the trenches with you.</p>
	<p>However,The enemy is not the child –– the enemy is you.</p>
	<p>Well, sometimes the child is the enemy. Sometimes it's the school or the grandparents or the various sytems you live in.</p>
	<p>You can't control those things though –– you have the most control over you.</p>
