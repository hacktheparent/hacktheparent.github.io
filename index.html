	<h1>Hack the Parent</h1>

	<p>Parenting is a war of attrition. Your spouse is your comrade, in the trenches with you.</p>

	<p>However, the enemy is not the child –– the enemy is you.</p>

	<p>Well, sometimes it's the child. Sometimes it's the school or the grandparents or the various sytems you live in and around.</p>

	<p>You can't control those things –– you have the most control over you.</p>

	<p>* * *</p>

	<p>Before I started <a href="/posts/bringingupbebe.html">reading parenting books,</a> I didn't know the best time to learn about parenting is before you have a kid.</p>

	<p>It's kind of obvious in retrospect –– your sole job as a new parent is keep child alive. You're operating on limited sleep and other suboptimal conditions. You're fielding many opinions of many people (especially ones related to you) who want to do things however they did them back in the day.</p>

	<p>Ignore those who say "everyone does their best parenting before they have a kid." Hard things are worth doing. It is possible to strive at parenting like any other pursuit.</p>

	<p>I think parenting is worth striving for.</p>
