	<h1>Hack the Parent</h1>

	<p>Parenting is a war of attrition. Your spouse is your comrade, in the trenches with you.</p>

	<p>However, the enemy is not the child –– the enemy is you.</p>

	<p>Well, sometimes it's the child. Sometimes it's the school or the grandparents or the various sytems you live in and around.</p>

	<p>You mostly can't control those things –– you can control you.</p>

	<p>When I started <a href="/posts/bringingupbebe.html">reading parenting books,</a> I didn't know the best time to learn parenting is before you have a kid.</p>

	<p>It's kind of obvious in retrospect –– we spend a quarter life as a child, a quarter life as a young adult, and then half a life as a parent and a grandparent. And as a new parent your sole job is <i>keep child alive</i>. You're operating on limited sleep. You're fielding many opinions from many people (especially ones related to you).</p>

	<p>I am appropriately cynical about the scientific rigor surrounding parenting. I don't believe there are meaningful metrics for outcomes or that there is objectivity.</p>

	<p>Will we ever be convinced we did a good job as parents? It's hard to take credit for that. At what point is it the child's credit? Is it ever the parents' credit?</p>

	<p>Is there edge in parenting? If I had alpha, would I share it on the internet? Would anyone?</p>

	<p>We are all selfish creatures who want the best for us locally. We both want to grow the pie and take a relatively larger share of it. Life is not all about winning local games though. So maybe people would share. Maybe they believe it makes the pie bigger.</p>
	
	<p>I don't believe people do their best parenting before they have a kid. I spent hundreds of hours obsessing over red sauce. Analyzing and buying equipment and practicing. How we spend our time is therefore how we spend our life. Ultimately, once our child was born, I'm invested in parenting either way. But I don't want to be just pot committed.</p>

	<p>I believe the pursuit of excellence is worthy. I believe we can put our child in situations where we can get lucky. And maybe that's kind of it.</p>
