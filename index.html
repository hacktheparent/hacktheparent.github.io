	<h1>Hack the Parent</h1>

	<p>Parenting is a war of attrition. Your spouse is your comrade, in the trenches with you.</p>

	<p>However, the enemy is not the child –– the enemy is you.</p>

	<p>Well, sometimes it's the child. Sometimes it's the school or the grandparents or the various sytems you live in and around.</p>

	<p>You mostly can't control those things –– you can control you.</p>

	<p>When I started <a href="/posts/bringingupbebe.html">reading parenting books,</a> I didn't know the best time to learn parenting is before you have a kid.</p>

	<p>It's kind of obvious in retrospect –– we spend a quarter life as a child, a quarter life as a young adult, and then half a life as a parent and a grandparent. And as a new parent your sole job is <i>keep child alive</i>. You're operating on limited sleep. You're fielding many opinions from many people (especially ones related to you).</p>

	<p>I am appropriately cynical about the scientific rigor surrounding parenting. I don't believe there are meaningful metrics for outcomes or that there is objectivity.</p>

	<p>Will we ever be convinced we did a good job as parents? It's hard to take credit for that. At what point is it the child's credit? Is it ever the parents' credit?</p>

	<p>Is there edge in parenting? If I had alpha, would I share it on the internet? Would anyone?</p>

	<p>But we both want to grow the pie and take a relatively larger share of it. Life is not all about winning local games so perhaps we parents share -- we believe it makes the pie bigger.</p>
	
	<p>Ultimately, once our child was born, I'm invested in parenting either way. But I don't want to be just pot committed. How we spend our time matters. It's our life.</p>

	<p>I believe the pursuit of excellence is worthy. I spent hundreds of hours obsessing over red sauce. Analyzing and buying equipment and practicing. Is parenting less worthy?</p>

	<p>I don't know how much the needle moves with our efforts, but I believe we can put our child in situations where we can get lucky. And maybe that's kind of it..</p>
